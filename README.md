# Chuso's Free Soundfont Collection
### A simple, comprehensive and free soundfont collection, focusing on realistic and playable acoustic and orchestral instruments for today's live musicians.

Within the age of huge -and expensive- sample libraries that fullfill the dreams of every virtual composer, it seems that Soundfonts aren't needed anymore. However, some musicians still need the simplicity of these old fellows in live shows.

Chuso's Free Soundfont Collection (ChusoCol) is a simple collection of instruments that would help every live musician to establish their own setup. It is the collection I particularly use and update, and the samples come from a variety of open resources, such as Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra (http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/ ), Salamander Grand Piano (http://freepats.zenvoid.org/Piano/ ) or the GeneralUser GS (http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php ), as well as some samples by myself.

It is intended for live musicians who want the better sound with low requirements, in a library of ~300Mb. The library is still in alpha state, and improvements are being made. The final soundfont is compiled using Polyphone (http://www.polyphone.fr/ )
