# Chuso's Free Soundfont Collection
### A simple, comprehensive and free soundfont collection, focusing on realistic and playable acoustic and orchestral instruments for today's live musicians.

Within the age of huge -and expensive- sample libraries that fullfill the dreams of every virtual composer, it seems that Soundfonts aren't needed anymore. However, some musicians still need the simplicity of these old fellows in live shows.

Chuso's Free Soundfont Collection (ChusoCol) is a simple collection of instruments that would help every live musician to establish their own setup. It is the collection I particularly use and update, and the samples come from a variety of open resources, such as Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra (http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/ ), Salamander Grand Piano (http://freepats.zenvoid.org/Piano/ ) or the GeneralUser GS (http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php ), as well as some samples by myself.

It is intended for live musicians who want the better sound with low requirements, in a library of ~300Mb. The library is still in alpha state, and improvements are being made. The final soundfont is compiled using Polyphone (http://www.polyphone.fr/ )

## About ChusoCol

ChusoCol is a simple collection of samples that comes from a variety of Open Source resources. It is intended to be simple and quick to use, mainly to its application in live performances.

The whole collection is mainly focused in recreating acoustic instruments with a decent level of realism while maintaining a relatively small file size, so that it can be used in a wide range of equipment, from old laptops to VST hardware players, such as the Muse Receptor.

## Sources
The collection is a mixture of my own material and a compilation of different resources from the web. The most important sample source has been the General User GS bank by S. Christian Collins. Suplementary material comes from Jasper Blunk's webpage (french horn samples) and the sample collection by the University of Iowa.
